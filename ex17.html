            <p>
                In 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core ARPANET
            group, collaborated on what they called the Internetting Project. They wanted to link
            different networks together so that a host on one network could communicate with a
            host on a second, different network. There were many problems to overcome: diverse
            packet sizes, diverse interfaces, and diverse transmission rates, as well as differing
            reliability requirements. Cerf and Kahn devised the idea of a device called a gateway to
            serve as the intermediary hardware to transfer data from one network to another

        <h1>TCP/IP</h1>
        <p>
            Cerf and Kahnâ€™s landmark 1973 paper outlined the protocols to achieve end-to-end
            delivery of data. This was a new version of NCP. This paper on transmission control
            protocol (TCP) included concepts such as encapsulation, the datagram, and the functions of a gateway.
             A radical idea was the transfer of responsibility for error correction
            from the IMP to the host machine. This ARPA Internet now became the focus of the
            communication effort. Around this time responsibility for the ARPANET was handed
            over to the Defense Communication Agency (DCA).
